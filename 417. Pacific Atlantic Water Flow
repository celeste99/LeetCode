/*
Solution 1 - BF
vertex: coordinates
edges: 4-dir coordinates that has smaller/equal value

for each vertex, 
run DFS twice: to traverse the whole graph to see if it can reach one ocean

Time: O(|V| * (|V| + |E|)) = O(n^2)
Space: O(n)

Solution 2 - DFS + memo

edges: 4-dir coordinates that has smaller/equal value

for each vertex, 
run DFS twice: to traverse the whole graph to see if it can reach one ocean, while traversing the graph, memo each node can reach the ocean or not, mark node as visited after the memo.

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)

Solution 3 - flow from ocean
// S1: DFS + mark visited
// S2: KBFS
vertex: coordinates
edges: 4-dir coordinates that has larger value

for each vertex in the border:
	run dfs to tarverse all the vertex reachable, while traversing, mark it as visited record the vertex
